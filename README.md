## 🚀 Core Functionalities

### 1. **AI-Powered Optimization Engine**
Utilizes the **Gemini 3 Pro** model to calculate optimal learning paths.
- **Traversal Logic**: Minimizes cognitive cost across knowledge dependencies.
- **Constraint Handling**: Balances academic goals against strictly defined temporal (time) constraints.
- **Heuristic Weighting**: Factors in user-defined priorities for Academics, Skills, Efficiency, and Well-being.

### 2. **Structural Knowledge Mapping**
An interactive D3.js visualization of your academic substrate.
- **Dependency Tracking**: Visually maps foundational topics and their downstream requirements.
- **Node Inspection**: Deep-dive into specific modules to view cognitive load and importance magnitude.
- **Real-time Status**: Color-coded nodes (Pending, Active, Completed) provide a high-level overview of curriculum mastery.

### 3. **Automated Syllabus Processor**
Directly ingest PDF syllabi to build your knowledge graph.
- **AI Extraction**: Uses Gemini to parse complex academic documents.
- **Dependency Inference**: Automatically identifies prerequisite relationships between topics.
- **Automatic Scaling**: Assigns difficulty metrics and cognitive weights based on curriculum complexity.

### 4. **Technical Execution Unit (Pomodoro 2.0)**
A high-performance focus timer integrated with your execution stack.
- **Mode Switching**: Automated transitions between "Focus Intervals" and "Recovery Intervals."
- **Temporal Config**: Granular control over work and break durations.
- **Audio Feedback**: System-level notifications for cycle completions.

### 5. **Heuristic Substrate & Priority Config**
Fine-tune the system's decision-making bias.
- **Radar Visualization**: Real-time projection of your priority distribution.
- **Environmental Bias**: Toggle external responsibilities (Jobs, Clubs, Family) to dynamically adjust the optimization cost function.

### 6. **AI Analysis Engine (First Principles Tutor)**
A dedicated academic synthesis tool powered by **Gemini 3 Flash**.
- **First Principles Method**: Breaks down complex topics into their fundamental logical or mathematical foundations.
- **Rigorous Synthesis**: Provides professional, academic-grade explanations for any node in the knowledge graph.

### 7. **Sovereign Security Layer**
Advanced data protection and privacy controls.
- **Biometric Integration**: Support for FaceID/TouchID authentication.
- **Encrypted Tunnels**: Generate "Parental Access Keys" for secure, limited transparency.
- **Granular Permissions**: Control exactly which metrics (Reports, Load, Notes) are visible to external supervisors.

### 8. **Weekly Efficiency Reports**
Deep analytics on your academic throughput.
- **Cost vs. Output**: Area charts tracking cognitive load cost against efficiency output.
- **Burnout Mitigation**: System-verified analysis of mitigated "burnout vectors."
- **Data Export**: Sync logs and export reports for long-term tracking.
